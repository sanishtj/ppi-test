The PPI public website [contacts page][co] contains a list of all our offices with addresses, key contacts and geo location.




Create a REST API providing search results for the data in contacts.json.  
  
The fields that should be searchable are "office" and "contacts".  
  
Here are examples of queries that clients of the API can submit:  
https://example.com/api?query=Sean%20Carey  
https://example.com/api?query=Vancouver  
  
Use any technology you deem appropriate and write a short reason why you chose it.
